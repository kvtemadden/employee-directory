## Functionality
The employee directory generates a number of employees so that an employer can see all of their employees and their contact information quickly.

The directory can be quite large, so is filterable by using a search function.

When someone begins typing, any employees who have the same information in their name, email or city will filter.

The contents are also able to be ordered by name, either by A-Z or Z-A.
